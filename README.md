# Data Ressource Repository

This repo contains various curated ressources within the field of data.

The material reflects the three pillars in the data vertical: **Strategy**, **Engineering** and **Science**. Curated by **Tobias Morville**, but anyone is welcome to contribute.

The **score** is a **subjective metric** that can be summarised as "*How much would I recommend that you spend time on this, given the summary seems relevant to you?*".

## Strategy

**Keywords**: Data Strategy, Digital Transformation.
